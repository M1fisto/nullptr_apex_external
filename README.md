Do not judge strictly, I did it for training.

Implemented on a leak - mhyprot (who doesn't know, this is the GENSHIN IMPACT AC driver).

Aimbot - mouse_event if it does not work correctly, uncomment the commented out
get_best_target

WH - GlowESP, GlowITEM.

Overlay - DX9 , it is returned to the state of detection, in order to make it UD again, you just need not to use WS_EX_LAYERED | WS_EX_TRANSPARENT | WS_EX_TOPMOST flags, then make a random title overlay and render it a few pixels smaller than the game window.

Approximately 4 months - not updated.
